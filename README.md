# Bluetooth.. on arch?
Ah, bluetooth. Communicates from device to device very well. **But!** Oh, you have arch don't ya.
Well, unlucky for us, bluetooth doesn't work on arch out of the box. 
Luckily for you, I have just the solution!
One command. Yeah, you heard me right. One command is all you need to get started with my script!

In fact, let's go over it now..


#### Here's that one command:

``````
cd; curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strangetheproot/bluetooth-arch/main/Main.sh && sudo bash Main.sh
``````

Yup, it's that easy. Just copy and paste into your terminal.
